- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DoctrJones

  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating small, hyper-specific Python applications (see what I've got on here for examples!)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to optimize my programming style to not only make it more readable (lol), but more efficient and future-proof

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message here, that's about it!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm entirely self-taught, which means my code probably sucks! But hey, I'm having fun and no one's paying me to do this, so can't get too mad at me ;)
